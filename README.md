Perform feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting car fuel consumption based on various vehicle characteristics. By analyzing a dataset of car fuel consumption and emissions data from 2000 to 2013, we will identify key features that significantly influence fuel consumption and build a robust regression model.

## Future Work

Building upon the existing model, here are some potential avenues for future research:

1. Deep Learning Algorithms
Neural Networks: Explore deep neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to potentially capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.
Transfer Learning: Consider using pre-trained models from other domains (e.g., computer vision) and fine-tuning them for your specific task.

2. Continuous Model Updates
Data Stream: Implement a system to continuously ingest new data and update the model periodically.
Incremental Learning: Explore techniques like incremental learning or online learning to adapt the model to changing data distributions.

3. Addressing Imbalanced Data
Resampling Techniques: If the data is imbalanced (e.g., more samples in one class than others), techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can help balance the classes.   
Class Weighting: Assign different weights to samples from different classes during training to address imbalance.

4. Additional Features
Environmental Factors: Consider incorporating environmental factors like weather conditions, road conditions, or traffic congestion that might influence fuel consumption.
Driver Behavior: If data is available, analyze driver behavior patterns (e.g., aggressive driving, eco-driving) to understand their impact on fuel efficiency.
Vehicle-Specific Features: Explore vehicle-specific features beyond those already used (e.g., tire type, aerodynamics) that might be relevant.
